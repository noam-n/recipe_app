# recipe_app

A Flutter project.
An app that allows users to upload and save their recipes - and explore other people's recipes.
I made this app to help me learn Flutter in an hands on manner.

## Getting Started

Clone the app to VSCODE.
Make sure all the dependencies are there, if not enter 'pub get' in the terminal.

then you can run the app:
in terminal - 'flutter run'
then choose whichever platform you want to run the app on - for conveience chrome is usualyl the easiest to run on,
but you can of course run the app on android.
